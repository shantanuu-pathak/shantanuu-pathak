👋 Hi, I’m Shantanu, a Business Intelligence Analyst with interest in data analytics and BI development 📊
I work mainly with SQL Server, Power BI, DAX, and Azure Data Factory, building end-to-end data pipelines and dashboards that turn raw data into clear insights 🔍
I enjoy designing KPIs, star-schema models, and performance-optimized reports, and validating dashboards with business users through UAT ✅
Most of my projects involve high-volume data, Agile teamwork, and stakeholder collaboration 🤝
Currently, I’m exploring Microsoft Fabric and cloud analytics, and sharing practical BI projects here on GitHub 🚀
