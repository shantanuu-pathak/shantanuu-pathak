👋 Hi, I’m Shantanu, a Business Intelligence Analyst with interest in data analytics and BI development 📊
<br>🔍 I work mainly with SQL Server, Power BI, DAX, and Azure Data Factory, building end-to-end data pipelines and dashboards that turn raw data into clear insights 
<br>✅ I enjoy designing KPIs, star-schema models, and performance-optimized reports, and validating dashboards with business users through UAT
<br>🤝 Most of my projects involve high-volume data, Agile teamwork, and stakeholder collaboration 
<br>🚀 Currently, I’m exploring Microsoft Fabric and cloud analytics, and sharing practical BI projects here on GitHub
